# reaction_wheel_inverted_pendulum

- Repository that conatins the reaction wheel description and the files to simulate it in gazebo. This repo is based on
the reaction wheel inverted pendulum repo from the simpleFOC project, wich is available here: [https://github.com/simplefoc/Arduino-FOC-reaction-wheel-inverted-pendulum](https://github.com/simplefoc/Arduino-FOC-reaction-wheel-inverted-pendulum).  

- This repo has been adapted for a custom aplication, specifically for students in the Automatic Control course could develop and test their control algorithms in
a simulated environment rather than on real hardware.
