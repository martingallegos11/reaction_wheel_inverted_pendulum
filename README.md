# reaction_wheel_inverted_pendulum

- This repository conatins the reaction wheel description and the files to simulate it in gazebo. It's also based on
the reaction wheel inverted pendulum repo from the simpleFOC project, wich is available here: [https://github.com/simplefoc/Arduino-FOC-reaction-wheel-inverted-pendulum](https://github.com/simplefoc/Arduino-FOC-reaction-wheel-inverted-pendulum).  

- This repository has been adapted for a custom aplication, specifically for students in the Automatic Control course could develop and test their control algorithms in
a simulated environment rather than on real hardware.
